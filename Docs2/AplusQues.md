### Networked Host Services

<details>

<summary>Servers, Appliances, Ports</summary><p>

- client apps request services from server apps

<details><summary>Server Info</summary><p>

- Usually a process running in memory on networked system which sends out responses to requests made from a remote client system
  - can also be stand-alone hardware
- DNS: server that resolves hostnames to IP addresses.
  - 2 are needed for a company to host a website (1 for redundancy).
  - Hostname IP address set records are saved in zone files, and if not, they are requested from the root server (higher-level DNS server)
- DHCP: provides IP configuration information (address, subnet mast, default gateway, DNS server address) to clients, automatically. The scope determines what info is allowed to be shared with a client.
- Fileshare: (File Server) - central repo for storage, access and management of entwork files
  - NAS (network attached storage) can also be used for a file server
- Print Server: manages print requests and connects to network printers
- Mail: responsible for sending, receiving, managing emails.
  - Must run a specialized server package (Microsoft Exchange, Sendmail, Postfix, Exim) to be an actual mail server.
- Syslog: Collects info compiled through system monitoring when in a client-server model. (login events, errors, etc.)
  - messages include: facility code, severity level, logged event descriptions.
  - Made up of 3 main components: listener, database, management & filtering software.
- Web Server: listens for incoming requests, which it executes by responding w/ the requested content (text, images, video, running scripts)
  - examples: Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), Apache
- Authentication, Authorization & Accounting (Triple A or AAA)

</p></details>

- Internet Appliances
  - SPAM gateways
  - unified threat management (UTM)
  - load balancers
  - proxy servers

- Legacy system: systems that haven't been updated, usually due to an important app that can't run on an updated platform
- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA): high-level management system that controls manufacturing machines, processes, infrastructure settings, and building components.
  - type of critical legacy system category
- Embedded systems: non-computer devices that use computer technology, which can also become unable to update.

### Network Questions

1. You need to configure port forwaring on a SOHO router to host gaming server
2. If a computer can't connect to a wired network due to not receiving IP addresses from DHCP server the cause may be the DHCP IP pool is exhausted
3. IP addresses beginning w/ 169 are assigned automatically if an IP address can't be received from a DHCP server
    1. The DHCP client auto self-configures IP address & subnet mask if DHCP server isn't available by using APIPA (automatic private IP Addressing).
    1. Range from 169.254.0.1 - 169.254.255.254 & default class B subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. It then sends a broadcast to ensure that other PC's aren't using the address it chose.
4. Avoid low RF signal issues by using non-overlapping channels (1,6,11)
5. CAT5 trasmits data >= 100 Mbps at distances of 100 meters
6. Crossover cable can be used to make connection from 2 hubs, 2 swtiches, 2 routers, hub to switch, or computer to router
7. Bluetooth: a discovery and authentication process that validates the communication link
8. wake-on-LAN will allow sleeping computer to power on when job is sent
9. DHCP (Dynamic Host Config Protocol) server can auto configure parameters needed by NIC when computer first boots & enables central management of IP address allocation
10. non-shining link integrity indicator when cable is plugged in means there's no connection to rest of the LAN
11. link status indicator is small LED next to RJ45 connector that will shine when there's proper electrical conn
12. Default gateway being down won't affect LAN & it's devices; but user won't be able to access internet
13. RDP uses port 3389, which has to be pre-configured on each firewall end to allow access thru that port
    1. Remote that lets you use the GUI the user is using, not just CLI
14. SSH needs port 22 opened to allow access
15. The `MAC` (Media Access Control) address: 48-bit # (written as six 2-digit hexadecimal numbers) that uniquely ID's a device on a LAN
    1. IP address used to locate the proper network (layer 3)
    2. MAC address is used to locate the device on the local area network (layer 2)
16. `socket number` uniquely IDs one end of a communication session running on a network. A socket number shows the IP address & port number of one end of a session.
    1. ex. 66.83.10.24:443 is a socket number that shows a connection est. over HTTPS to the IP address.
17. HTTP uses port 80
18. The subnet mask that defines a full class C network is 255.255.255.0, while a full class B subnet mask would be 255.255.0.0.
19. enabling MAC filtering only allows access to devices listed in the routers filtering table
20. `RJ11/45` are common for phone lines & ethernet & use tristed pair cabling
21. `RFC1918` private address sets for IP addresses start with 192.168 (v4)
22. default gateway address is address that computer would send traffic to
    1. default gateway would be a router for SOHO network & sends traffic out to internet
23. Static address: manually assigning/entering IP address
    1. sometimes recommended in order to reserve the addresses in DHCP pool to prevent other devices from leasing the address
24. `LDAP` is successor to DAP and works w/ AD for user authentication and management within a network
25. `NAT` (Network Address Translation) enables the translation of private local network IPv4 addresses into a public addresses in order for them to connect over the Internet.
26. `DMZ` (demilitarized zone) sets up separate network that can be accessed from internet, making specific services reachable by external users, but not allowing access to remainder of network (ex. email/web/FTP servers)
27. `DSL` makes use of phone lines that already exist & are limited by dist. from central office
28. `ISDN`: integrated services digital network supports use of bearer (B) channels for sending data & D chan. for signal/control

### Cable Types

#### Network Cables

- 3 primary types: **coaxial**, **twisted pair**, **fiber**
- used for connecting devices to networking equipment
- cable: medium (usually copper) where the data is transferred from devices
  - composed of four pairs of twisted-pairs (8 total) individual cables in one sheath

| Cat Cables | | |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| Name | Speed | Distance |
| 5 | 100 Mbps | 100 m |
| 5e | 1000 Mbps (1Gbps) | 100 m |
| 6 | 10 Gbps | 55 m |
| 6a | 10 Gbps | 100 m |
| 7, 8, 9 + | => | => |

1. 5e has less interference due to separation of the four twisted pairs sets & increase in number of twists in each cable pairs
2. **Coaxial cable**: single copper-cored cable contained in an inner insulation layer, which is contained in a wire mesh conductor, then placed w/in an outer insulation layer. Specification by the RG system (Radio Guide)
   1. RG-6: solid copper core used for satellite/cable modems
   2. RG-59: solid copper core used for cable TV
3. **Twisted copper pair**: pairs of individual wires twisted into pairs and then twisted together, contained w/in an insulated jacket
   1. unshielded twisted pair (UTP): 2-4 pairs of twisted wires, where the pairs are twisted in direct contact w/ each other and contained w/in an insulating layer so the copper doesn't directly touch the other copper wire
   2. shielded twisted pair (STP): 2-4 twisted wires, and each pair is contained in a braided foil sheathing layer, prior to being twisted w/ the other cable pairs, which reduces electrical interference. (used in Cat 7-8 cables)
   3. Color coded for reference:
      1. T568A (green/white, green, orange/white, blue, blue/white, orange, brown/white, brown) & T568B (orange/white, orange, green/white, blue, blue/white, brown)
         1. standards for RJ-45 wiring connectors
4. Direct burial is where the cables are buried underground and should contain STP cables w/ add'l waterproof sheathing. Should be 6-8 inch underground in protective PVC piping and away from other lines that have electrical currents
5. Plenum: teflon type covering used in cables exposed to heat or that may release gasses into vent system.
6. Optical is a transmission method that uses light pulses to transfer data
7. **Fiber optic cables**: fiber (small strings of flexible glass) is surrounded by rubberized coating w/ transmission speeds of 100 Mbps - 10 Gbps over several miles. (optical data transmission)
   1. immune to electrical interference & wiretapping
   2. Two types: *single-mode*: carries one light path, sourced from a laser (much longer distance than multi) and *multimode*: carries multiple light paths sourced by an LED.

#### Connector types

- installed at terminating pt. of cable; allows components & peripherals to connect; type used depends on the cable and what receptable it needs connected to.

1. RJ11: registered jack; telecomm net interface standard for voice/data equipment connection to service providers/carriers.
   1. used w/ twisted pair cables & connects 4-6 wires to phone lines or modems
2. RJ45: ethernet cable
3. F-type: F connector; used w/ coaxial cables for cable/satellite data connections
4. Fiber optic cable connectors

   2. SC:subscriber connector; push/pull style
   3. LC: lucent connector; push/pull; half the size of the SC; good fit for office/data center usage
5. Punchdown block: elec connection device that inserts multiple copper wires into a slot for added insulation and electrical connection to attached wires.
6. USB: universal serial bus (attach peripheral devices to computing devices) (Peripheral cable)
   1. 2.0 standard has max speed of 480 Mbps (hi-speed) & 3.0 has max speed of 5 Gbps (Supper Speed)
   2. `Micro` (smallest) & `Mini` (2nd smallest) direction dependent connectors containing 5 pins
   3. `USB-C`: most recent connector type w/ 24 pins, an oval shape, and capable of reversible connection
7. Molex: older interconnection type for drive connections that used a two-piece pin & socket
8. Lightning Port: Apple proprietary connector featuring 8 pins and reversible orientation
9. DB9: Used for serial connections to network device consoles & management ports. 9 pins (2 rows of 4 & 5 pins),trapezoid shaped connector
   1. serial cable used for serial comms w/ a matching serial connector at the end

#### Hard Drive Cables

- Connections (drive interfaces), can be on or off-board and are used to connect internal components to mobo
- attachment standard depends on HDD requirements and features circuitry and a header (port)

1. SATA: serial advanced tech attachment
   1. most common and features a flat, internal cable that has a terminating connector that only fits the mobo connection port in one way.
   2. data cable: 7 pins, power cable: 15 pins
   3. revisions = {'1.0': '1.5Gbps', '2.0': '3Gbps','3.0': '6Gbps', '3.2': '16Gbps'}
2. SCSI: small computer system interface: hard drive connector (usually for storage device connection)
   1. ribbon cables or round cables w/ 50, 68, or 80 wires
   2. One SCSI cable is able to connect up to 16 devices (including MoBo & SCSI controller card)
3. eSATA: external SATA cable, used for data transmission (doesn't provide power)
   1. Power over eSATA, eSATA+, eSATAp, eSATA/USB versions provide power
4. IDE: Integrated drive electronics cables (PATA, parallel advanced tech attachment)
   1. 40-pin flat data cables w/ colored strip on one edge to show the location of pin 1
   2. composed of 3 separate connectors, 2 for drives and 1 for power

### RAID

1. RAID 0 striped across drives to improve performance but w/ no redundancy
2. RAID 10 combines mirroring for data protection and striping for speed
   1. provides full redundancy via mirroring and stripping all info stored w/in the drives
   2. requires atleast 4 drives
3. SATA drive uses 15-pin connector
4. SSDs are non-volatile memory with fast performance and lower power consumption than HDD
5. `Backup Types`
   1. Full backup: all chosen files are backed up and Archive bit is set to ON afterwards
   2. Incremental backup: only edited/new files since last bakup are backed up
   3. Differential backup: similar to incremental, except archive bit isn't set, which will cause the next diff backup to include files that were backed up during previous backups
6. `Blu-ray discs` can be single or multiple-use and split into categories based on 3 factors
   1. Functionality: BD-R single use, BD-RE/RW multi-use (RE-recordable erasable is newer)
   2. Capacity: BD-SL(25gb), DL(50gb), BD-XL = TL(100gb) & QL(128gb)
   3. Content quality: regular(1080p high def vid) and ultra HD(4k ultra HD, better colour depth; region-free, but need 4k Blu-R player)

### Troubleshoot

1. If pagination error is occuring and causing random **BSOD** crashes, but otherwise computer works then
   1. check for OS and hardware drivers; run CMDs to check HDD for errors and check system files; in advanced sys settings, disable auto manage paging files for all drives and set custom. Check RAM sticks and possible W10 reinstall.
2. An unset date/time may be due to drained BIOS battery; resolved by CMOS batter replacement
3. Startup repair can be used to prevent reinstalls and is designed to auto start if W10 detects issues.

## Operational Procedures

- grounding diverts excess electrical charges from the device and can decrease chance of damage from electrical spike
- ESD mats/straps lower risk of ESD by balancing the static electricity between the tech and device/component

## Software Troubleshooting

1. NIC allows for wireless comms between laptop and wireless access points.
2. physical privacy and sec comp are designed to prevent the loss of info thru physical means such as shoulder sufting/theft

## Security

1. Adware: malicious software that displays advertising banners when run
2. Malware removal
   1. identify and research malware symptoms
   2. quarantine infected system
   3. disable system restore
   4. remediate infected ssytems
   5. schedule scans and run updates
   6. enable system restore
   7. educate end-user

## Sample Ques

1. QoS = quality of service. In a SOHO env, QoS set at router level. If you want to enforce it's policies on your network, you need to use a router equipped w/ QoS software
2. Consult manual docs before doing preventive maintenance, or cleaning operations to get proper methods and solvents
3. SMTP protocol can send emails from a client device (only for outgoing messages)
4. A multi-layer switch enables having both switching and routing functionality on the same device
5. ST is a type of fiber connector
6. Port 443 (HTTPS) used when using SSL encryption to access a website
7. Light emitting diode and in-plane switching monitor technology have widest viewing angle w/ rich color & consistent backlighting
8. Enable device pairing to use hands-free for a smartphone to car
9. Can connect a tone generator to an RJ-45 drop to locate the position of the cable on a patch panel
10. Check case for overheating and mobo for swollen capacitors if computer reboots at random intervals multiple times/day
11. check fuser if printer is smudging toner on the paper after printing
12. computer may have incorrect drivers installed if print jobs are printed as garbled text
13. Startup tab in Task Manager utility shows proccesses. initialized at startup
    1. earlier Windows versions used MSConfig
14. Disk cleanup utility deletes temp fi from HDD
15. `WinRE` helps recover a sys that won't boot. It auto starts and can be manually started via Windows Recovery settings in Advanced startup menu
